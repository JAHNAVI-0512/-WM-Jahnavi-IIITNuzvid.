# Smart Waste Bin Network using IoT and Fog Computing

This repository is part of the virtual IoT design challenge.

- **Hardware/** – smart dustbin hardware architecture (ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, LoRa, battery).
- **Software/** – ESP32 / LoRa code and pseudocode.
- The report explains how the system measures fill level, uses fog computing at 50% threshold, and sends data to the cloud for route optimization.
